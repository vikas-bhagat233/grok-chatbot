Here are a few options for your LinkedIn post. Choose the one that best fits your style!

## Option 1: The "Showcase" (Best for engagement)

🚀 **Excited to share my latest project: An Advanced AI Chatbot powered by Groq & Llama 3!** 🤖✨

I built a full-stack AI assistant from scratch using **Python (FastAPI)** and **Vanilla JS**. It's not just text—it can see, hear, and draw!

🔥 **Key Features:**
*   **👁️ Vision Capabilities**: Upload images and get instant detailed analysis using Llama 3.2 Vision.
*   **🎨 AI Image Generation**: Integrated the **Flux model** to generate stunning, photorealistic images on demand.
*   **🗣️ Voice Interaction**: Real-time **Speech-to-Text** and **Text-to-Speech** for hand-free conversations.
*   **📊 Diagramming**: Auto-generates technical flowcharts and sequence diagrams directly in chat using **Mermaid.js**.
*   **📂 Document Analysis**: Chat with your PDFs, Excel sheets, and PPTs.
*   **✨ Modern UI**: Custom glassmorphism design with multiple themes (Cyberpunk, Midnight, Ocean) and mobile-responsive layout.

It was an amazing experience integrating these cutting-edge models into a cohesive, fast local application.

## Option 2: The "Technical" (Focus on skills)

**Just shipped: A Local Multimodal AI Agent.** 🛠️

I wanted to explore the limits of local-first AI interfaces, so I built a chatbot that leverages the speed of the **Groq API**.

**Tech Stack:**
*   **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn
*   **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3 (Glassmorphism)
*   **Models**: Llama-3.1-8b (Chat), Llama-3.2-Vision (Image Analysis), Flux (Image Gen)

**Engineering Highlights:**
*   Implemented a custom **auto-naming system** for chat sessions.
*   Integrated **Web Speech API** for native browser-based voice control.
*   Built a highly optimized **Markdown renderer** with syntax highlighting and dynamic **Mermaid.js** support for engineering diagrams.
*   Containerized with **Docker** for easy deployment.

Efficient, fast, and completely free to run locally. ⚡

## Option 3: Short & Sweet

I built my own **AI Assistant** using **Groq** and it's incredibly fast! ⚡

It handles everything from **Voice conversations** and **Image analysis** to generating **Flowcharts** and **Art**. Built with Python + FastAPI and a custom beautiful UI.

The coolest part? It runs locally and feels premium. 🎨
